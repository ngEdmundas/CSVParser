CSV Parser
======

The program shouls allow the user to enter arbitrary CSV formatted text into textarea and display a nice HTML table representing the entered data.

CSV parsing should be done according to this specification: [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180] (2nd section).

Unit tests are not necessary, but would be a big bonus.

No 3rd party libraries dealing with CSV parsing can be used while solving the task.
